          <p> Iâ€™m Heather Jansen. Iâ€™m an award-winning designer based in Oakland with over eight years of
experience in brand storytelling and collaborating across teams to design user-focused products.
 <br><br>
I am brave and take risks, and doing so is the only reason I have gotten to where I am today. One example is my return
to design as my second career in 2013. I have also recently completed a UX Bootcamp to solidify my web expertise. Doing so 
confirmed design is my thing, agnostic of form. Iâ€™m adaptable and know how to make a path forward. 
<br> <br>
One of my first jobs was answering 1-800 hotline calls for Ball Canning. It taught me how to problem-solve on the spot and 
also gave me great empathy for users. When I worked internationally with National Geographic licensing brand and book publishing 
rights in other languages, I carried that thinking with me. I lean on that knowledge now when I advocate for user-testing and research analyzation 
that ensure products are made for the people using them.
<!-- This experience helped when I worked globally helping people publish books in their local languages. -->
<br> <br>
I am a collaborator at heart. Working with others motivates me, but I also know from experience
that a genuine team effort makes a more significant product. I believe that helping others
succeed, having a positive outlook, and thinking of the big picture leads to more success for everyone. 
<br> <br> 
I am a curious self-starter; I never stop learning and Iâ€™m good at it. I am fueled by figuring out how things work 
and then finding ways to make them better. I love the discovery and development process of building a brand or experience. 
Troubleshooting code with developers actually sparks joy. Time spent testing button states and interaction makes me tick.
<br><br> 

The secret to my success as a designer is my diverse experience, a proven research and iteration process for achieving 
results and my relationship building skills. I'm recognized as resourceful, a great mentor and group facilitator and a clear communicator. 
 
            
            <br><br>I'm currently unlearning the use of a double space after punctuation. ;)

          <h3 class=> What can we make together?</h3>
          <p><span id="fun">Fun Facts:</span> I'm a Cubs fan, indie music nerd, and an Instagram photographer (much to
            the chagrin of my darkroom loving soul). I can't resist a triple layer chocolate cake. In my free time, I like to sew
            clothing, pet cats, and mentor others.</p>

          <!-- <br><br>I was one of twelve people for a national live portfolio review with AIGA this past July. Iâ€™ve also
            recently completed a UX/UI Bootcamp through UC Berkeley which has confirmed that design is definitely my
            thing, in whatever form itâ€™s packaged. Iâ€™m recognized as resourceful and proactive, a clear
            communicator, and a leader with effective relationship building skills. and then making the
design process more efficient.  From solving home-canning problems on a 1-800 hotline, to helping publishers localize content for
            their market, to creating the best messaging for an advertising campaign or designing user interfaces, my
            work is rooted in empathy and finding solutions to my clientâ€™s (or userâ€™s) problem.

            <br><br> I am inherently curious, an ideas person, and enjoy finding the why and how for every project. Iâ€™m
            a self-starter, a strategic thinker and approach every project with the big picture in mind. My perspective and
experiences make me a better designer.-->

          <p>When I get stuck whether in my design work or in life, I turn to several of the practices listed in this
            collage. I gather inspiration everywhere and add them to my moodboards. I take walks or get out in nature 
            to clear my head. I research the topic, ask questions, and run A/B tests on designs with my colleagues. 
            I create phyiscal art by hand with uncommon materials as my medium or scribble in Procreate after a long day.
            <br>
            <br>Whenever it gets hard, I remind myself to look for the bright spot. It will get better around the corner, if I just stay focused and keep going. <br> <br> These tools are crucial for me to produce high-impact design work.  </p>
